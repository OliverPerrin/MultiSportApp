AI-Powered Multi-Event Calendar and Recommendations Platform

Welcome to the AI-Powered Multi-Event Calendar and Recommendations Platform! This application aggregates events across multiple niches—ESports, Formula 1, skiing, soccer, hiking, American football, tennis, trail running, recreational running, and track running—and uses AI to deliver personalized recommendations. Users can view upcoming events in an interactive calendar, explore trending streams and activities, and easily purchase tickets via external links.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
	•	Docker & Docker Compose installed
	•	Node.js (v16+) and npm (v8+)
	•	Python (3.10+) and virtualenv
	•	Git

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-event-calendar.git
cd multi-event-calendar


	2.	Backend setup

cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Frontend setup

cd ../frontend
npm install


	4.	Start services with Docker

docker-compose up --build

This will launch the backend API on http://localhost:8000 and the React frontend on http://localhost:3000.

Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the backend/ directory with the following:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/events
EVENTBRITE_API_KEY=your_eventbrite_key
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_twitch_client_id
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_twitch_secret
SPORTSDATA_API_KEY=your_sportsdata_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

Note: Never commit .env to source control. Use a secrets manager in production.

Usage

Running Locally
	1.	Ensure Docker Compose is running (docker-compose up).
	2.	In a separate terminal, start the React app:

cd frontend
npm start


	3.	Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and create a user profile.
	4.	Explore events in the calendar, adjust your interests, and see AI-driven suggestions.

Event Tickets

For all sporting events (e.g., F1 races, soccer matches, American football games, tennis tournaments), the app lists schedules alongside direct “Buy Tickets” links. Clicking a link takes the user to a trusted ticketing partner (e.g., Ticketmaster, StubHub), so you don’t need to manage ticket sales or scheduling yourself.

Example:

Event	Date	Venue	Tickets
Australian GP	2025-03-21	Albert Park	Buy Tickets
Premier League Match	2025-08-17	Old Trafford	Get Tickets


⸻

API Integrations
	•	Eventbrite: General public events
	•	Twitch: Live esports streams
	•	SportsData.io: Official sports schedules (free tier)
	•	OpenWeatherMap: Current & forecasted weather for outdoor recommendations
	•	Custom Scrapers: For niche calendars without public APIs

Refer to /docs/api_integrations.md for endpoint specs and examples.
